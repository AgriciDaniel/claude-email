## PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solve)

### Structure
1. **Problem**: Identify a specific pain point the reader experiences
2. **Agitate**: Amplify the emotional or practical consequences of the problem
3. **Solve**: Present your solution as the resolution

### When to Use
- Cold emails (builds empathy before pitching)
- Re-engagement campaigns (reminds of unresolved pain)
- Empathy-driven industries (healthcare, consulting, services)

### Template
```
Subject: [PROBLEM_QUESTION]?

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

[PROBLEM_STATEMENT]. Most [TARGET_AUDIENCE] struggle with [SPECIFIC_PAIN_POINT], and it's costing them [COST_OR_CONSEQUENCE].

Here's what makes it worse: [AGITATION_DETAIL_1]. And when [TRIGGER_EVENT] happens, [NEGATIVE_OUTCOME].

We built [PRODUCT/SERVICE] to solve exactly this. [ONE_SENTENCE_SOLUTION].

[SOCIAL_PROOF_OR_RESULT].

[CLEAR_CTA]

[SIGNATURE]
```

### Example (Local Business)
```
Subject: Losing customers to Google reviews?

Hi Sarah,

73% of consumers trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations. But if you're a local restaurant owner with under 4 stars on Google, you're losing 3 out of 4 potential customers before they even call.

Here's what makes it worse: negative reviews rank higher than positive ones in Google's algorithm. And when a competitor with 4.5 stars opens down the street, your phone stops ringing.

We built ReviewRocket to solve exactly this. We turn happy customers into 5-star Google reviews in under 60 seconds—no apps, no logins, just a text message.

Our clients see an average of 47 new reviews in the first 90 days.

Can I show you a 2-minute demo this week?

Best,
Daniel

## Framework Combinations

Advanced campaigns often blend frameworks:

- **PAS → AIDA**: Problem hook → excitement build → action
- **BAB → 4Ps**: Transformation vision → proof stack → urgency
- **AIDA → FAB**: Attention grab → technical depth → benefit closeout

Choose based on:
- **Audience awareness**: Cold (PAS) vs Warm (AIDA) vs Hot (4Ps)
- **Product complexity**: Simple (AIDA) vs Technical (FAB)
- **Campaign goal**: Awareness (BAB) vs Conversion (4Ps)

---

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid)

- **Burying the lede**: Don't hide the problem/promise in paragraph 3
- **Skipping agitation**: Problem without consequences = no urgency
- **Feature dumping**: Features without benefits = "so what?"
- **Proof-free promises**: Claims without evidence = skepticism
- **Weak CTAs**: "Learn more" vs "Start your free trial" (specific wins)

---

## Testing Frameworks

A/B test frameworks by:
1. Same audience, same offer, different structure
2. Track open (subject), click (body), convert (CTA)
3. Winner becomes control for next test
4. Iterate on winning framework (test variations within structure)

Most campaigns benefit from 2-3 framework tests before settling on a winner.
