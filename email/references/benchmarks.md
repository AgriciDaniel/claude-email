## Open Rate Benchmarks by Industry (2025)

| Healthcare | 37-44% | 2.05% | 5.08% | 0.16% | 0.85% |
| Software/SaaS | 35-39% | 2.10% | 5.38% | 0.18% | 0.90% |
| E-commerce | 31-33% | 1.98% | 6.01% | 0.22% | 1.10% |
| Restaurants | 35.42% | 1.76% | 4.97% | 0.19% | 0.95% |
| Real Estate | 38.65% | 2.28% | 5.90% | 0.15% | 0.80% |
| Education | 42.18% | 2.54% | 6.02% | 0.13% | 0.70% |

**Notes:**
- CTOR (Click-to-Open Rate) = (Clicks / Opens) × 100 (measures email content quality)
- Open rates are unreliable where Apple Mail Privacy Protection (MPP) is prevalent. MPP pre-fetches all emails, registering 100% opens for Apple Mail users (~50-60% of email opens). True open rates may be significantly lower than reported. Use click rate and CTOR as more reliable engagement metrics.
- Industry benchmarks updated Q1 2025

## Scoring Methodology

When scoring emails, use weighted averages:

**Note on Open Rates:** Due to Apple MPP (see notes above), open rates are increasingly unreliable. When audience has high Apple Mail penetration (>40%), consider shifting open rate weight to click rate or CTOR for more accurate scoring.

**Critical Metrics (40%):**
- Deliverability (bounce <1%, spam <0.05%): 20%
- Open rate vs industry benchmark: 20%

**High Priority (35%):**
- Click rate vs industry benchmark: 20%
- CTOR (content quality): 15%

**Medium Priority (25%):**
- Unsubscribe rate: 10%
- Mobile optimization: 10%
- A/B testing evidence: 5%

**Score Calculation Example:**
```
Email scores 80% on deliverability (20 * 0.8 = 16)
Email scores 90% on open rate (20 * 0.9 = 18)
Email scores 70% on click rate (20 * 0.7 = 14)
Email scores 85% on CTOR (15 * 0.85 = 12.75)
Email scores 95% on unsub rate (10 * 0.95 = 9.5)
Email scores 100% on mobile (10 * 1.0 = 10)
Email scores 60% on testing (5 * 0.6 = 3)

Total Score: 16 + 18 + 14 + 12.75 + 9.5 + 10 + 3 = 83.25/100
```

**Score Bands:**
- 90-100: Excellent (top 10%)
- 75-89: Good (industry average)
- 60-74: Warning (needs optimization)
- <60: Critical (major issues)

## Anti-Patterns (Performance Killers)

| Anti-Pattern | Impact | Fix |
|--------------|--------|-----|
| All-caps subject | -20% open rate | Sentence case |
| "Click here" CTA | -15% click rate | Action-specific text |
| No mobile optimization | -30% click rate | Responsive design |
| Image-only email | -50% deliverability | 60/40 text-to-image ratio |
| Purchased list | -70% engagement | Organic signups only |
| No segmentation | -50% conversion | Segment by behavior |
| Sending without testing | -30% performance | A/B test everything |

Use these benchmarks to set realistic goals, identify underperformers, and prioritize optimizations.
