## Priority Automation Sequences

### 1. Welcome Series (5-7 emails)

**Trigger:** Email signup
**Goal:** Introduce yourself, set expectations, build relationship, surface best content

- Email 1 (immediate): Welcome, who you are, what to expect (frequency, content type)
- Email 2 (day 1): Your story (why you create, your mission, authenticity)
- Email 3 (day 3): Best piece of content #1 (most popular or foundational)
- Email 4 (day 5): Best piece of content #2 (different format or topic)
- Email 5 (day 7): Best piece of content #3 (showcase range)
- Email 6 (day 10): How they can support you (paid tier, share, engage)
- Email 7 (day 14): What's next (upcoming content, community, call to action)

**Personalization:** Segment by signup source (social platform, topic interest, content type)

### 2. Content Drip (Best-of Archive)

**Trigger:** After welcome series completes OR for dormant subscribers
**Goal:** Surface evergreen content, demonstrate value, re-engage

- Weekly drip of top 10-20 pieces of content
- Mix formats (articles, videos, podcasts, threads)
- Add new commentary or updates to each piece
- Ends with CTA to paid tier or product
