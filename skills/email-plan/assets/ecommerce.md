## Priority Automation Sequences

### 1. Abandoned Cart Recovery (3-4 emails)

- Email 2 (24 hours): Social proof (reviews, testimonials) + urgency
- Email 3 (48 hours): Incentive (10% off, free shipping)
- Email 4 (72 hours - optional): Last chance, scarcity (low stock)

**Optimization:**
- Include product images, prices, direct cart link
- Test incentive timing (email 2 vs. email 3)
- Exclude if order completed (real-time check)

## Dynamic Content and Personalization

E-commerce thrives on personalization. Use these tactics:

1. **Product Recommendations:**
   - Based on browse history
   - Based on purchase history
   - Collaborative filtering (customers who bought X also bought Y)

2. **Dynamic Discount Codes:**
   - Unique codes per customer (track usage, prevent sharing)
   - Tiered discounts (VIP gets 20%, others get 10%)

3. **Abandoned Browse:**
   - Track products viewed but not added to cart
   - Send "Still interested?" email with viewed products

4. **Inventory Alerts:**
   - "Back in stock" for wishlisted items
   - "Low stock" urgency for cart items

5. **Birthday/Anniversary:**
   - Birthday discount (if birth date collected)
   - Anniversary of first purchase

## Revenue Attribution

E-commerce emails should be measured by revenue impact, not just opens/clicks.

**Attribution Models:**
- **Last-Click:** Email gets credit if it's the last touchpoint before purchase
- **First-Click:** Email gets credit if it's the first touchpoint
- **Multi-Touch:** Distribute credit across all touchpoints

**Klaviyo Revenue Metrics:**
- Attributed revenue (purchases within 5 days of email click)
- Placed order rate (% who purchased after email)
- Revenue per recipient (total revenue / total recipients)

## Compliance Notes

- **CAN-SPAM (US):** Physical address, unsubscribe link
- **GDPR (EU):** Explicit opt-in, right to erasure
- **Pre-Checked Boxes:** Illegal in EU, allowed in US (but use cautiously)
- **Transactional Emails:** Order confirmations, shipping updates (exempt from marketing rules)

## Best Practices

1. **Product Images:** Always include high-quality product images
2. **Clear Pricing:** Show prices, discounts, savings (build trust)
3. **Mobile-First:** 60-70% of e-commerce emails opened on mobile
4. **Urgency/Scarcity:** Limited-time offers, low stock alerts (increase conversions)
5. **Social Proof:** Reviews, ratings, customer photos (build trust)
6. **Free Shipping:** Highlight free shipping thresholds prominently
7. **Easy Checkout:** Direct cart links, one-click checkout (reduce friction)
8. **A/B Testing:** Test product order, image size, CTAs (data-driven optimization)
9. **Segmentation:** Don't send men's products to women (unless unisex), etc.
10. **Lifecycle Stage:** Treat first-time buyers differently than VIPs
