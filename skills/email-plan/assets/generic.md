# Generic Email Strategy Template

## Overview

This is a fallback template for businesses that don't fit clearly into local-business, SaaS, e-commerce, creator, or agency categories, or for personal email lists.

Use this when:
- Business type is unclear or hybrid
- Personal newsletter or side project
- Testing email marketing before committing to specific strategy
- Starting with minimal resources and growing over time

## List Building Strategy

1. **Website Signup Form**
   - Prominent form on homepage, about page, blog
   - Clear value proposition (what they'll get)
   - Minimal friction (just email, maybe name)

2. **Social Media Links**
   - Link in bio on all platforms
   - Regular CTAs in posts to join email list
   - Platform-specific landing pages to track sources

3. **Content Marketing**
   - Blog posts with inline and end-of-post CTAs
   - Lead magnets (free guide, checklist, template)
   - Gated content for premium resources

4. **Referrals and Word-of-Mouth**
   - Ask existing subscribers to share
   - Include "forward to a friend" link in emails
   - Social share buttons in emails

5. **Offline Capture**
   - Business cards with QR code
   - Speaking events, networking
   - Print materials with signup URL

## Segmentation Plan

Start simple, expand over time.

| Segment | Criteria | Frequency | Content Type |
|---------|----------|-----------|--------------|
| New Subscribers | Signed up in last 30 days | 1-2/week | Welcome, introduction, expectations |
| Engaged | Opened 3+ of last 5 emails | 1-2/week | Regular content, more frequent |
| Dormant | No opens in last 30 days | 1/month | Re-engagement, best-of content |

**Future Segmentation Ideas:**
- By signup source (social platform, website, event)
- By interest/topic (if collecting preferences)
- By engagement level (opens, clicks, replies)
- By action taken (purchased, downloaded, attended)

## Priority Automation Sequences

### 1. Welcome Series (3-5 emails)

**Trigger:** Email signup
**Goal:** Introduce yourself/brand, set expectations, build relationship

- Email 1 (immediate): Welcome, who you are, what to expect (frequency, content)
- Email 2 (day 2): Your story or mission (why you do what you do)
- Email 3 (day 5): Value demonstration (best content, testimonial, resource)
- Email 4 (day 10 - optional): How to get the most value (preferences, actions)
- Email 5 (day 14 - optional): Call to action (follow on social, buy, refer)

### 2. Nurture Sequence (Optional)

**Trigger:** After welcome series
**Goal:** Continue delivering value, build trust

- Weekly or bi-weekly emails with best content
- Mix of educational, entertaining, promotional (80/20 rule)
- Encourage engagement (replies, social follows, shares)

### 3. Re-engagement Sequence (3 emails)

**Trigger:** 30-60 days no opens
**Goal:** Win back attention or clean list

- Email 1: "Are you still interested?" + value reminder
- Email 2: Best content since they last engaged
- Email 3: Breakup email ("Click here to stay subscribed, or we'll remove you")

## Content Calendar

**Email Frequency:** 1 email per week (consistency over volume)

**Content Mix:**
- Value-add/Educational: 80% (tips, insights, how-to, stories)
- Promotional: 20% (products, services, offers, asks)

**Weekly Template:**

| Week | Email Type | Content Idea |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| Week 1 | Educational | How-to guide, tip, tutorial |
| Week 2 | Storytelling | Personal story, lesson learned, case study |
| Week 3 | Curated | Links, resources, recommendations |
| Week 4 | Promotional | Product, service, ask (purchase, refer, share) |

**Content Ideas:**
- Share what you're learning
- Behind-the-scenes of your work/life
- Tips and how-to guides
- Book/article/tool recommendations
- Personal stories and lessons
- Industry news and commentary
- Q&A or reader questions
- Monthly roundup of best content

## Platform Recommendations

**Best for Beginners:** Mailchimp Free Tier or MailerLite Free

**Mailchimp Free** (0-500 subscribers, 1000 emails/month)
- Pros: Easy to use, good templates, generous free tier
- Cons: Branding on emails, limited automation on free tier

**MailerLite Free** (0-1000 subscribers, 12K emails/month)
- Pros: More generous free tier, unlimited emails, automation included
- Cons: Fewer integrations than Mailchimp

**Upgrade Path:**
- **Under 1000 subs:** Stay on free tier
- **1000-5000 subs:** Mailchimp or MailerLite paid ($10-30/month)
- **5000+ subs:** Consider industry-specific platform (Kit.com for creators, ActiveCampaign for automation)

## KPI Targets

Start with basic metrics, expand as you grow.

| Metric | Realistic Target | Notes |
|--------|------------------|-------|
| Open Rate | 20-30% | Varies by audience size and engagement |
| Click Rate | 2-5% | Depends on content and CTAs |
| Unsubscribe Rate | <1% | Higher than 1% signals content/frequency issue |
| List Growth Rate | 5-10%/month | Depends on promotion and channels |

**Track Weekly:**
- Number of new subscribers
- Open rate of latest email
- Click rate (if applicable)

**Track Monthly:**
- Overall list growth
- Average open rate
- Top-performing emails (by opens, clicks, replies)
- Unsubscribe trends

## Strategy Progression

As your email list grows, evolve strategy:

### Phase 1: 0-500 Subscribers (Focus: Consistency)
- Send 1 email per week on consistent schedule
- Welcome series only (3 emails)
- Minimal segmentation (just new vs. existing)
- Focus on quality content, building habit

### Phase 2: 500-2000 Subscribers (Focus: Engagement)
- Add segmentation (engaged vs. dormant)
- A/B test subject lines
- Re-engagement sequence for dormant
- Track content performance, double-down on winners

### Phase 3: 2000+ Subscribers (Focus: Optimization)
- Advanced segmentation (interests, behavior)
- Multiple content tracks for different segments
- Revenue attribution (if selling products/services)
- Platform upgrade if needed (more features, integrations)

## Compliance Notes

- **CAN-SPAM (US):** Physical address in footer, unsubscribe link
- **GDPR (EU):** Explicit opt-in, privacy policy, right to erasure
- **Best Practice:** Double opt-in (confirm subscription via email) to reduce spam complaints

## Best Practices

1. **Consistency:** Same day and time each week (train audience)
2. **Subject Lines:** Clear and honest (no clickbait, deliver on promise)
3. **Personalization:** Use subscriber's name if collected
4. **Mobile-First:** 60%+ of emails opened on mobile
5. **One CTA:** Guide reader to single action (don't overwhelm)
6. **Reply-To:** Use real email address, encourage replies
7. **Unsubscribe:** Make it easy (builds trust, improves deliverability)
8. **Value First:** 80% value, 20% promotion (build trust before asking)
9. **Story-Driven:** People remember stories more than facts
10. **Test and Learn:** A/B test subject lines, send times, content types
