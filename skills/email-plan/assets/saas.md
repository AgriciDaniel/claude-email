## Priority Automation Sequences

### 1. Onboarding/Feature Adoption (7-14 emails)

**Trigger:** Trial signup or paid account creation
**Goal:** Drive activation, reduce time-to-value, prevent early churn

**Trial Onboarding (14-day trial example):**
- Day 0 (immediate): Welcome, login credentials, quick start guide
- Day 1: First core feature walkthrough (high-impact, easy win)
- Day 2: Second core feature tutorial
- Day 3: Integration setup guide (if applicable)
- Day 5: Customer success story (similar use case)
- Day 7: Mid-trial check-in, offer demo/support
- Day 10: Advanced feature highlight
- Day 12: Trial ending soon, upgrade benefits
- Day 14: Last day urgency, special offer

**Behavioral Triggers:**
- If feature X not used by day 3 → send feature X tutorial
- If no login in 48 hours → re-engagement email
- If completed key action → congratulations + next step

### 2. Trial-to-Paid Conversion (3-5 emails)

**Trigger:** Trial days 7-14
**Goal:** Convert trial users to paid subscribers

- Email 1 (day 7): Value recap, customer testimonial

**Trigger:** New feature launch
**Goal:** Drive adoption of new feature, demonstrate innovation

**Segmentation:** Only send to users who would benefit (don't spam all users)

### 4. NPS/Feedback Collection (1-2 emails)

- Email 2 (detractors 0-6): "What can we do better?" + support offer
- Email 2 (promoters 9-10): "Thanks! Mind leaving a review?" + referral ask

### 5. Churn Prevention (3-5 emails)

## Behavioral Triggers

SaaS email success depends on behavioral triggers, not just time-based sequences.

**Positive Triggers (encourage behavior):**
- User completes onboarding checklist → congratulations + next feature
- User hits usage milestone → celebrate + case study
- User invites teammate → team collaboration tips
- User uses feature X → related feature Y tutorial

**Negative Triggers (prevent churn):**
- No login for 7 days → re-engagement email
- Support ticket opened → check-in after resolution
- Downgrade plan → retention offer
- Feature not used in 30 days → tutorial + value reminder

**Lifecycle Triggers:**
- Trial day 3, 7, 10, 12, 14 → onboarding sequence
- 30-day mark → NPS survey
- 60-day mark → feature adoption check
- 90-day mark → quarterly business review offer

## Compliance Notes

- **GDPR:** Explicit opt-in for marketing emails (transactional exempt)
- **CAN-SPAM:** Physical address, unsubscribe link
- **Double Opt-In:** Recommended for trials (reduce fake signups)

## Best Practices

1. **Personalization:** Use name, company, role, use case in emails
2. **Behavioral Segmentation:** Send based on actions, not just time
3. **Video:** Demo videos increase engagement 2-3x
4. **Social Proof:** Customer logos, testimonials, case studies
5. **Clear CTAs:** One primary action per email (login, watch, read)
6. **Mobile-Optimized:** 40-50% of SaaS emails opened on mobile
7. **Transactional Emails:** Onboard via transactional (higher open rates)
8. **A/B Testing:** Test subject lines, send times, CTAs (data-driven optimization)
9. **Lifecycle Stage:** Tailor content to trial vs. paid vs. at-risk
10. **Internal Champions:** Identify power users, nurture into advocates
