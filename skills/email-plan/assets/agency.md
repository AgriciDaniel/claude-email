## Thought Leadership Strategies

Agencies win on expertise, not price. Email is key channel for demonstrating thought leadership.

- Annual state-of-industry analysis
- Data-driven insights (surveys, research)

### 2. Original Frameworks
- Proprietary methodologies
- Unique approaches to common problems
- Visual frameworks (diagrams, templates)

### 3. Behind-the-Scenes
- How you approach projects
- Lessons learned from failures
- Internal processes and tools

### 4. Predictions and Hot Takes
- Industry predictions (where things are headed)
- Controversial opinions (backed by data/experience)
- Challenges to conventional wisdom

### 5. Client Spotlights
- Deep-dive case studies
- Client interviews (co-created content)
- Before-and-after transformations

## Proposal Follow-Up Best Practices

Long sales cycles require persistent, value-add follow-up.

**Timing:**
- Day 1: Confirmation email (did you receive it?)
- Day 3: Social proof (case study)
- Day 7: Objection handling (address concerns)
- Day 10: Urgency (availability, opportunity)
- Day 14: Alternative offer (smaller scope, phased)

**Content:**
- Never just "checking in" (always add value)
- Share relevant case study or insight
- Address specific objections (pricing, timeline, scope)
- Offer alternatives (phased approach, smaller pilot)

**Multi-Channel:**
- Email + LinkedIn message
- Email + phone call
- Email + video message (Loom, Vidyard)

## Client Retention Strategies

Acquiring new clients costs 5-10x more than retaining existing ones.

### 1. Quarterly Business Reviews (QBRs)
- Schedule every 90 days
- Review performance, results, ROI
- Identify opportunities, challenges, roadmap

### 2. Proactive Communication
- Monthly updates (even if no major news)
- Industry insights relevant to their business
- Early access to new services or beta features

### 3. Surprise and Delight
- Unexpected value adds (bonus deliverables)
- Personalized recommendations
- Holiday gifts or thank-you notes

### 4. Upsell and Cross-Sell
- Identify adjacent needs (related services)
- Gradual expansion (pilot new service area)
- Bundle services (discounted package)

### 5. Referral Program
- Incentivize client referrals (discount, bonus services)
- Make it easy (referral link, one-click introduction)
- Thank publicly (testimonial, case study, social shoutout)

## Compliance Notes

- **CAN-SPAM (US):** Physical address, unsubscribe link
- **GDPR (EU):** Explicit opt-in for B2B contacts (business cards = legitimate interest, but best practice is re-permission email)
- **CASL (Canada):** Express or implied consent (existing business relationship = implied for 2 years)

## Best Practices

1. **Personalization:** Use company name, industry, specific pain points
2. **Segmentation:** Treat prospects, clients, partners differently
3. **Value-First:** Every email should add value (insight, case study, tool)
4. **Thought Leadership:** Position as expert, not vendor
5. **Long-Term Nurture:** B2B sales take months; stay top-of-mind without being pushy
6. **Multi-Stakeholder:** B2B decisions involve multiple people; provide shareable content
7. **Mobile-Optimized:** 40-50% of B2B emails opened on mobile
8. **Clear CTAs:** Schedule call, download case study, reply with question
9. **Social Proof:** Client logos, testimonials, industry recognition
10. **CRM Integration:** Track email engagement in CRM (lead scoring, deal stage updates)
